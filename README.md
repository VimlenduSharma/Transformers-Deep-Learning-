Transformers-Deep-Learning
A curated collection of hands-on Jupyter notebooks demonstrating state-of-the-art Transformer architectures for Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision tasks.
Transformers have revolutionized deep learning by introducing self-attention mechanisms that excel at modeling long-range dependencies in data. This repository provides end-to-end examples:

Vision Transformers: Understanding and implementing self-attention in image patches.

BERT Fine-Tuning: Applying BERT to Named Entity Recognition tasks.

Question Answering: Building an extractive QA system using pretrained Transformers.

PyTorch Implementations: Practical code examples with PyTorch and Hugging Face‚Äôs transformers library.

üß∞Prerequisites

Python 3.7 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
Git
For GPU acceleration:
NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN installed

‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VimlenduSharma/Transformers-Deep-Learning-.git
cd Transformers-Deep-Learning-
Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install transformers torch torchvision datasets seqeval jupyter

üìä Results
Each notebook contains visualizations and performance metrics. You‚Äôll see:
Attention heatmaps over image patches (Vision Transformers)
Entity-level precision/recall for NER tasks
Exact match (EM) and F1 scores for question answering
Feel free to modify hyperparameters, swap datasets, or integrate with your own data!
